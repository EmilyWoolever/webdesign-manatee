        <h1>Manatee Habitats</h1>
            <h2>Habitat</h2>
                <h3>Geographic Locations of All Manatee Species</h3>
                    <p>Three species of manatee exist: West Indian, Amazonian, and West African. The West Indian manatee is divided into two separate subspecies: Florida manatee and Caribbean manatee. They are thought to be distinct subspecies because of the large body of water separating them from one another.</p>
                    <p>West Indian manatees can be found along the coastal and inland waters of the southern United States, throughout the Caribbean Islands, and along the eastern coasts of Mexico and Central America and the northern coast of South America.</p>
                    <p>Manatees live in shallow, calm rivers, estuaries, saltwater bays, canals, and coastal areas. Manatees move from fresh to salt water with no problem. In the United States, the Florida manatee inhabits the state&rsquo;s coastal waters, rivers, and springs.</p>
                <h3>Migration</h3>
                    <p>During the warmer months, some Florida manatees travel up the eastern coastline into Georgia and the Carolinas with a few animals traveling as far north as Massachusetts. In the Gulf, Florida manatees can be found west through coastal Louisiana and are occasionally sighted as far west as Texas.</p>
                    <p>In preparation for winter, manatees travel to migrate back to areas with warm water such as natural springs or power plant discharge canals. Florida is at the northern end of the sub-tropical manatee's winter range. These warm-water habitats play an important role in their survival during the winter months because Manatees can suffer from cold stress in water colder than 68 degrees F.</p>
