         <h2>Body Stats</h2>
            <p>Florida manatees are large, gray, aquatic mammals, though algae often grows on the backs and tails of manatees, which makes their skin color appear green or brown.</p>
           <img src="images/algae.png">
            <p>Though they can grow larger and heavier, adult manatees are typically:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>9-10 feet long from snout to tail</li>
                <li>weigh around 1,000 pounds</li>
                </ul>
            <p>They have some distinct physical traits:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Their small eyes have a membrane that can cover the eyes for protection.</li>
                <li>The ear openings are small and they have no external lobes.</li>
                <li>They have a flexible lip pad that is used to move food into their mouth.</li>
                </ul>
            <p>Manatees are long-lived and reproduce slowly. Age estimates based on growth rings in ear bones indicate <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/life-span">life spans</a> of up to 59 years, and at least one manatee has survived more than 69 years in captivity.</p>
        <h3>Swimming and Breathing</h3>
            <p>Like other mammals, manatees breathe air. Nostrils are located above the snout and have valves that tightly close when the manatee is under water.</p>
